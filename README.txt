Each python file is a separate implementation of the classifier using
train.csv and test.csv in the current directory. All files were designed
to run using Python 2.7. For dependencies, follow the following steps:

1) Create a new virtual environment using virtualenv
2) Source into the new environment
3) Run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt"

After the pip dependencies install, you can run the Python files.
Please email ahesselgrave@ucla.edu if any issues arise. The 
requirements were tested on Ubuntu and CentOS systems, but should 
work in any UNIX style system like Mac and BSD.
